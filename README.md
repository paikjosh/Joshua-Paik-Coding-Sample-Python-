# Joshua Paik Python Coding Sample
For this project, I have written codes in Python that cleans and performs basic analysis on time series data.

Descriptions of files in this repo:
  1) File titled "data_clean.py" contains a series of codes that cleans time series data.
  2) File titled "data_analysis.py" contains a series of codes that performs time series analysis.
  3) File titled "test.py" is where I have implemented codes that are on both files described above by using sample data of "TS_sample_data_euro(Sheet1)-2.csv" and "TS_sample_data_dollar(Sheet1)-2.csv"

All Python files in this repo contain descriptions of codes that I’ve written. However, all of them lack my thought process that went into writing those codes. Hence, I’ll use the space below to talk about that.
